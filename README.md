Abstract:

The concept of fuzzy soft sets was defined and applied to a decision-making problem by Maji et al.
in 2001. The decision-making method used therein has potential for applications in several areas such as
machine learning and image processing. Recently, this method has been configured by Enginoğlu and Memiş
via fuzzy parameterized fuzzy soft matrices (fpfs-matrices), faithfully to the original, because a more general
form is needed for the method in the event that the parameters have uncertainties. However, in the case that a
large amount of data is processed, the configured method denoted by MBR01 has a disadvantage concerning
time and complexity. To deal with this problem and to be able to use this method effectively, we propose an
algorithm in this paper, i.e. sMBR01, and prove that sMBR01 is equivalent to MBR01. We then compare the
running times of these two algorithms. The results show that sMBR01 is more successful than the other in any
number of data. Especially while a large number of objects are processed, sMBR01 offers up to 82.9602% of
time advantage and while a large number of parameters are processed, sMBR01 offers up to 79.1337%.
Afterwards, we apply this method to a performance-based value assignment to some filters used in noise
removal, so that we can order them in terms of performance. Finally, we discuss the need for further research.
